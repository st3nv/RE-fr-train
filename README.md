# RE: FR-Train: A Mutual Information-Based Approach to Fair and Robust Training

This is the reproduction of the paper "FR-Train: A Mutual Information-Based Approach to Fair and Robust Training" (ICML 2020) by Yuji Roh, Kangwook Lee, Steven Euijong Whang, and Changho Suh, published in Proceedings of the 37th International Conference on Machine Learning, 2020.

We carried out further experiments on the FR-Train algorithm and the code is available in the `exp` directory.
